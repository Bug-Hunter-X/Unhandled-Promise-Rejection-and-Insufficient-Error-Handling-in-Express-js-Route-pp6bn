# Unhandled Promise Rejection and Insufficient Error Handling in Express.js Route
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in asynchronous route handlers.  The provided code lacks proper error handling for database operations, leading to generic 500 error responses and potential unhandled promise rejections.
The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and the use of async/await for better clarity and error management.
## Bug
The primary issue lies in the `/users` POST route.  The database interaction (`db.createUser`) is not handled properly.  Errors during database operations are logged to the console, but the client only receives a generic 500 error, lacking context on the nature of the failure.
## Solution
The solution involves several improvements:
1. **Explicit error handling:** The `catch` block now explicitly handles errors, providing more informative error responses to the client.
2. **Using async/await:** Async/await syntax improves code readability and makes error handling more straightforward.  The code is clearer in its handling of success and failure scenarios.
3. **Specific Error Messages:** The error response now sends details about the database error to improve debugging for both developers and clients.  Consider using a dedicated error handling middleware to handle this more generally.
This improved error handling significantly enhances the application's robustness and provides more helpful feedback to the user and developer.
